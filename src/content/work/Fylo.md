## Fylo Dark Theme Landing Page

Solved the challenge of designing a visually striking and functional dark theme landing page. By carefully considering typography, color scheme, and layout, I created a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. This project demonstrates my ability to translate design concepts into functional web experiences.
