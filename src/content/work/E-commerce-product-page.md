## E-commerce product page

Showcased my front-end development skills by building a dynamic and interactive e-commerce product page. Implemented a visually appealing lightbox gallery for product images, a user-friendly cart system, and a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring this project to life.
